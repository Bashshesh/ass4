Description This project was made in Java with IntelliJ Idea. This project was writed to laboratory in my University. 
I guess that this project will see only my teacher, but this README is still important. 

I had this steps to my assignment, i guess i did it all

1.Create an additional class for testing K (example: MyHashTable<MyTestingClass, Student> table = new MyHashTable<>();)

2.Create your own hashCode() method in MyTestingClass (You are not allowed to use default hashing methods like Objects.hash())

3.Add random 10000 elements to your hashtable and print number of elements in each bucket (chain or linkedlist).

4.Tune your hashCode method in MyTestingClass so that it does not violate the uniform distribution.
